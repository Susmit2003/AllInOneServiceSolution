## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to convey trust and reliability. This color is versatile and contrasts well with both light and dark backgrounds, contributing to a calm user experience.
- Background color: White smoke (#F5F5F5), providing a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Green (#81C784) to highlight important actions and confirmations. Its slightly increased brightness and saturation draws user attention without being jarring, creating effective contrast against the primary blue.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to give the app a modern and user-friendly appearance. This font is highly legible and contributes to a clean, uncluttered interface, and can serve for both headlines and body text without requiring a font pairing.
- Use simple, clean icons that clearly represent each service category and action. Use a consistent style for all icons to maintain a cohesive look.
- Use a grid-based layout for service listings to ensure a clean and organized presentation. Prioritize key information such as ratings and availability.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states and transitions to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
